# Password Strength Checker

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of a password. It evaluates the password based on specific criteria, including length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Concepts and Theory

### Password Strength
Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute-force attacks. A strong password typically has a combination of various character types and sufficient length to provide security against unauthorized access.

### Criteria for Assessing Password Strength
1. **Length**: Longer passwords are generally more secure because they have more possible combinations, making them harder to guess or crack.
2. **Uppercase Letters**: Including uppercase letters increases the complexity of the password, adding to its strength.
3. **Lowercase Letters**: Similar to uppercase letters, lowercase letters add variety and complexity.
4. **Numbers**: Adding numbers introduces another layer of complexity, making the password harder to predict.
5. **Special Characters**: Special characters (such as @, #, $, etc.) significantly increase password complexity and strength because they add a wide range of possible characters to the password.

### Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex) are used in this tool to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Regex provides a concise and flexible means to match strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters.
